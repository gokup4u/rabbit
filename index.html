        <h3>Little introduction to the rabbit world.</h3>
        <p class = "pcontent">By current zoological classification, the order <em>Lagomorpha</em> is split into two large families: the <em>Ochotonidae</em> and <em>Leporidae</em>.</p>
        <p class = "pcontent">Rabbits and hares are members of the <em>Leporidae</em> family. </p>
        <img class= "images" src= "img/doe2.jpg" alt="lovely doe">
        <p class = "pcontent">The taxonomic classification of the <em>Leporidae</em> proposed by <strong>Wilson and Reeder </strong>(1993) has been accepted as divided into 11 genera, </p>
        <p class = "pcontent">one of which, the genus <em>Sylvilagus</em>, deserves special mention due to the widespread presence throughout the North American continent of its 13 species</p>
        <p class = "pcontent"> (known as the cottontail, among which is <em>Sylvilagus floridanus</em>, known in Europe as the “mini-hare”). </p>
        <p class = "pcontent">Two members of the family are the genus <em>Lepus</em>, with its 30 species of hares originally from the Old World,</p>
        <p class = "pcontent"> and the genus Oryctolagus, also originally from Europe, which has only one species, Oryctolagus cuniculus, or the European rabbit. </p>
        <p class = "pcontent">The three genera (Figure 1) differ in the number of chromosomes (Sylvilagus 2n = 42; Lepus 2n = 48; Oryctolagus 2n = 44),</p>
        <p class = "pcontent">so crossmatings are infertile and do not generate crossbreeds (Robinson et al., 2002).</p>
